    """A primordial dependency linker that assign requirements based on ELF dependencies.

    This dependency linker will expand all ``search_patterns`` and try to analyse all files as ELF.

    For each ELF, this dependency linker will retrieve all the ELF dependencies. It will then see if any of those dependencies
    are either provided by another package of the same build; or try to fetch the list of repositories
    written in the :py:mod:`~core.config` file (in the order indicated) to find the unique package that contains
    any of those files; and add it as a requirement.

    :param packages: The packages which should have their dependencies assigned
    :paramtype packages: ``List`` [ :py:class:`.Package` ]

    :param search_patterns: A list of patterns which should match any ELF file present in the package's content.
        Any element of this list supports the globbing and braces syntax of common shells.

        The default value is: ::

            [
                '{,usr/}}bin/*',
                '{,usr/}}lib{,32,64}/*',

                'lib/*'

            ]

    :paramtype search_patterns: ``List`` [ :py:class:`.Package` ]
    :param local_resolving: Indicate whether or not other packages for ``packages`` should be used to solve dependencies. Default value is ``True``.
    :param remote_resolving: Indicate whether or not remote repositories should be used to solve dependencies. Default value is ``True``.
