"""Provides types and functions to create and manipulate a build manifest and all its components.

A build manifest is a set of instructions that fetches, compiles, and splits a software into one or more packages.
It is typically made of three main parts:

  * A set of metadata used as a reference for the metadata of the built packages
  * A list of versions and a corresponding set of data, one per version, called the versionized arguments of a build
  * A list of instructions (taking the form of a python function) that builds the packages

The build manifest can then generate a list of :py:class:`.Build` for each version in the versionized arguments.
Those :py:class:`.Build` s will take as parameter (among other things) the set of data associated with this version.

For example, it may have a field named ``url`` holding a URL pointing to the source code of the software.
Therefore, this field will hold the correct URL for all versions and is easily accessible in a uniform, version-independent way.

*Example of an illustrated versionized list of arguments:*

+---------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| Version | Value of the field ``url``                    | Value of the field ``sha256``                |
+=========+===============================================+==============================================+

+---------+-----------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+
| 1.1.0   | ``https://example.com/software_1.1.0.tar.gz`` | ``e258d248fda94c63753607f7c4494ee0fcbe9...`` |

class BuildManifest():
    """A build manifest is a set of instructions that fetches, compiles, and splits a software into one or more packages.

    It is made of three components:

      * A set of metadata used as a reference for the metadata of the built packages
      * A list of versions and a corresponding set of data, one per version, called the versionized arguments of a build
      * A list of instructions (taking the form of a python function) that builds the packages

    **Versionized Arguments:**

    The field ``versionized_args`` is a list. Each entry in this list represents a new version of the software.
    The entries are a dictionary holding the build's arguments for each version.

    It must have a key named ``semver`` that holds the version number, following `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0`_.

    All the remaining pairs of key/value can be used freely. Some functions of the standard compilation library (:py:mod:`stdlib`)
    may use them as generic, version-agnostic arguments. To ensure future compatibility, the standard compilation library reserves
    all key names that don't start with an underscore (``_``).

    For example, the function :py:func:`stdlib.fetch.fetch` is used to download files (like the source code) before building a software.
    It looks for an entry named ``fetch`` in ``versionized_args`` that contains the elements needed to download a file (like its URL, its hash etc.)
    (See the documentation of :py:func:`stdlib.fetch.fetch` for more informations.)

    Here is an example of ``versionized_args`` for a build manifest supporting two versions (``1.0.0`` and ``1.1.0``) of the software
    and uses the function :py:func:`stdlib.fetch.fetch` to download the source code::
