    """Download, build and wrap a library based on ``autoconf`` and ``make``.

    This exhaustive template is made of 9 steps:
        * ``fetch``
        * ``extract``
        * ``patch``
        * ``configure``
        * ``compile``
        * ``check``
        * ``install``
        * ``split``
        * ``dependency linking``

    For each one of these steps, a function is called. This template simply calls each of them in the above order.
    All of these functions can be given as arguments, but each one of them has a default value that is explained below.
    If any of those functions is ``None``, the step is skipped.

    **Fetch**

        This step is used to download the source code. The default value is :py:func:`.fetch` with no argument.

    **Extract**

        This step is used to extract the downloaded source code. The default value is :py:func:`.flat_extract_all` with no argument.

    **Patch**

        This step is used to patch the downloaded source code. The default value is :py:func:`.patch_all` with no argument.

    From now on, the current working directory is changed in favor of ``build_folder`` (which defaults to ``.``).
    If the directory pointed by ``build_folder`` doesn't exist, it is created.

    This is useful for the few ``configure`` scripts that don't work if they aren't executed in a standalone directory.

    **Configure**

        This step uses the ``configure`` script to configure the source code. The default value is :py:func:`.configure` with no argument.

        When ``build_folder`` isn't ``.``, it is usually necessary to override this step with an other call to :py:func:`.configure` with
        the argument ``binary='../configure'``.

    **Compile**

        This step compiles the source code. The default value is :py:func:`.make` with no argument.

    **Check**

        This step runs the unit and integration tests. The default value is :py:func:`.make` with the arguments ``'check'`` and ``fail_ok=True``.

    **Install**

        This step installs the software in the install cache. The default value is :py:func:`.make` with the arguments ``'install'`` and
        ``f'DESTDIR={stdlib.build.current_build().install_cache}'``

        If this step is overriden, the ``DESTDIR`` variable is crucial and should be reused. Otherwise, and unless the ``configure`` script has been
        configured to work without it, the installation can damage and overwrite parts of the host system.

    **Split**

        This step is still a work in progress. The default value is ``None``.

    **Dependency Linking**

        This step is still a work in progress. The default value is ``None``.
